<!--
Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

A navbar

A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

eg. On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

                        California. I attended California State University Long Beach for four years, and graduated in
                        May
                        of 2018 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science. For two of those years, I was a TA for
                        Intro
                        to
                        Java and Intro to Python classes at CSULB.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about-me-text">I currently work part time at 85°C Bakery in National City, so while I
                        fulfill
                        my childhood dreams of being a cake decorator, I am pursuing my new dreams of being a Web
                        Developer.
                        In
                        my spare time, I like to sing, play guitar, and cook. I am the youngest of three siblings, and I
                        have
                        an 8 year old Chihuahua/Terrier named Bruno. </p><br>
